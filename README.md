Wordpress boilerplate for Google App Engine deployment
======================================================

This is a Wordpress installation boilerplate prepared specifically for easy 
Wordpress core and plugins updating via composer.

Contains script for easy prepare to Google App Engine deployment.

You can learn about installing WP on GAE [here](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/appengine-php-wordpress-starter-project/).
Problem with original [google’s boilerplate](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-php-wordpress-starter-project) is that you have to use git submodules to update WP and plugins and it’s hard to maintain.
